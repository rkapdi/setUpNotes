#Step 1: Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host

$ ssh-keygen


#Step 2: Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh-copy-id

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <linux.csc.uvic.ca>


#Step 3: Create a ~/.ssh/config file on local-host

Host csc
    HostName linux.csc.uvic.ca
    User <netlink_id>
Now you can just type ssh csc to log in.
